## 💡 How It Works

### Daily Flow

1. **Morning** - ChoreBoard automatically creates today's chores based on schedules
2. **Throughout the day** - Household members view the board, claim, and complete chores
3. **Evening** (5:30 PM) - Unclaimed chores are automatically assigned fairly
4. **Midnight** - Points are awarded, chores marked overdue, new day begins

### Weekly Flow

1. **During the week** - Complete chores, earn points, build streaks
2. **Sunday midnight** - Weekly reset happens automatically:
    - Weekly points are converted to cash (e.g., 100 points = $1)
    - Streaks are updated (perfect week = bonus!)
    - Points reset for the new week
    - All-time points continue accumulating

### Chore Types

- **Pool Chores** - First-come, first-served. Anyone can claim these.
- **Fixed Chores** - Assigned to specific people automatically
- **Undesirable Chores** - Rotate fairly among eligible household members

# Or use a specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/choreboard2:v1.0.0
```

### Building from Source

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
